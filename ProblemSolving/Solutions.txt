A Cat, a Parrot, and a Bag of Seed:
A man finds himself on a riverbank with a cat, a parrot and a bag of seed. He needs to transport all three to the other side of the river in his boat. However, the boat has room for only the man himself and one other item: either the cat, parrot or seed). In his absence, the cat could eat the parrot, and the parrot would eat the seed. Show how he can get all the passengers to the other side, without leaving the wrong ones alone together.


1) Define the problem.
    a) In this problem we start with three objects all in Category A. We would like to recategorize each object to category B, wihout ever having certain pairs of objects in the same category. With objects C, P, and S, we are not allowed to have the pairs CP or PS both in the same category at the same time.
    b) For insight, I ignore most of the words and think in terms of symbols, sets and relationships.
    c) The goal is to recatgorize each object while adhereing to the constraints mentioned in part a).

2) Break the problem apart
    a) The constraints are that we can't have the pairs CP or PS in the same category at the same time.
    b) The sub goals could be to recategorize each individual object within the aforementioned constraints.

3) Identify potential solutions
    a) We can let category A be 'on the first shore without the man' and category B be 'on the second shore without the man'. 

i) To recategorize object C, we could put C and S into category A and P into category B. Then we remove the category from C, and add it to category B while simultaneously removing the category from object P.

ii) To recategorize object P, we can just put it into category B and have objects C and S in category A.

iii) To recategorize object S, we can start with C and S in cat A and P in cat B. Then remove the cat from S, and give S cat B while simultaneously removing cat B from P.
